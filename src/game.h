// GME Namespace: Main game handling and data
/*
	All the game data is held in the GME namespace. All data is ultimately held in the GME_Game
	superstruct. The game can be in multiple states, such as the main menu, a level, or the
	level editor. Some data is common to all states, such as the screen. Other things, like the
	map for a level, are held in specific state structs in a union. Each state struct has an
	associated enum value in GME_State and three associated functions:

	* GME_<STATE>_init(GME_Game *game, ...): Initializes the state. These can take more
	  parameters if they need more information to start up. These will automatically
	  deinitialize the current state with GME_deInitState. If there is a problem in
	  initialization, they will deinitialize themselves and throw an error.
	* GME_<STATE>_deInit(GME_Game *game): Deinitializes the state. These must not be called
	  unless the state they are deinitializing is currently active. It generally isn't
	  necessary to call these since the init functions will deinitialize automatically.
	* GME_<STATE>_loop(GME_Game *game): The mainloop for the state. These not be called unless
	  the state they are deinitializing is currently active. This will be called automatically
	  in GME_loop.

	In general, it is only necessary for most code to call GME_<state>_init, and everything else
	will be handled by the game automatically.
