	  four pixels (offset + width) will collide badly with walls if the object turns around while it is touching.
	* Objects moving at fast speeds may clip around outer corners, but it only happens at extremely high speeds with barely
	  noticeable results.

/* Returns the ORed hit direction(s) and priority hit direction:
	* The ORed 'HIT_*' return value(s) describe the sides of the second object that the first is hitting, e.g. 'HIT_TOP | HIT_LEFT'
	  means that the first object is moving into the top and left sides of the second.
		* If no direction could be determined in a single dimension, no value is ORed for that dimension, e.g. if both
		  objects are not moving horizontally at all, the return value will have neither 'HIT_LEFT' nor 'HIT_RIGHT'.
		* A collision of e.g. 'HIT_TOP' does not imply that the first was above the second before this collision. The first
		  might have already been in the second object before this frame, and therefore didn't actually hit the top of the rect.
		  All the same, a 'HIT_TOP' value is returned to show that this is the side that is being hit.
	* The single or blank 'HIT_PRIO_*' return value describes the primary side that the first object is hitting. It is
	  essentially the same as the 'HIT_*' values except that it only gives a single value which is the most prominant.
		* For instance, a 'HIT_PRIO_TOP' shows that the first object mainly stomped or landed on top of the second. In the same
		  example, the hit values might have been 'HIT_TOP | HIT_LEFT', giving the complete story that it was mainly a stomp with
		  a smaller move to the left as well.
		* If two 'HIT_*' values are equivalent in strength, the priority will favor the X direction over the Y. The rationale
		  is that if the character lands on an enemy at a perfect 45 degree angle, it will probably be more likely that the
		  enemy would hurt the player. This circumstance is rare, so it likely doesn't matter much.
		* A priority hit can have a directional value when the corresponding hit doesn't have anything in that dimension, e.g.
		  'HIT_PRIO_LEFT | HIT_TOP'. This means that both object are moving in that dimension at the same speed. So, in the previous
		  example, both objects are moving left at the same speed, but that left motion is larger than the vertical motion.
		* A priority hit can also have no value. This will only happen if both objects are not moving at all but are touching.
	Got all that? There are a lot of edge cases. If you're confused, look at some object code.
