	/* Linked list of objects in the level:
		* The data type is a linked list, but it is different than most. All the objects are in a continguous chuck of
		  malloc'ed memory but in no particular order. This minimizes heap fragmentation, but the linked list component means
		  that new objects can just be added to the end of the chunk of memory. On deleting an object, the last object in the
		  list is moved into the emptied position and the list pointers are updated.
		* The player is a special object. The player is kept in the list with the objects instead of being completely externalized
		  because the benefits of sorting also apply to it as well as ensuring that there is at least one object in the list at all
		  times, greatly simplifying the code.
		* The indicies are u16 because there can never be more than 65535 objects (not 65536 so NULL_INDEX has a u16 number) and
		  everything is in the same list, so it is cheaper than a pointer.
		* When anything talks about a slice or reigon, it doesn't mean a slice in memory, but a slice from one index to another
		  through obj.right/left including both the start and end indexes in the slice.
		* The linked list is always organized according to the object's X position in the level from left to right. This allows
		  for an active object slice, which can grow and shrink more easily than a fixed size list of active objects. The
		  downside is that newly created objects and objects that have moved must be sorted.
